# Mid Bootcamp
 Working as an analyst for a real estate company. My (fake) company wants to build a machine learning model to predict the selling prices of houses based on a variety of features on which the value of the house is evaluated. Also preparing some dashboard useful for data visualization and exploration

## MySQL Exploration
Attempt to gain a deeper understanding of our dataset by using MySQL. 

-Uploading dataset into a Database/ Creating Table

-Observing Qualities and answering business questions

-We observed better unique values of columns, what sort of association they have with each other, the average price of properties, etc

-Business questions Data Analysts can quickly refer to when asked about specific properties

## Tableau Visualisation 
Visualize the data and dig further into it. Investigation on the most costly areas, the most in demand types of homes, and the years in which newly constructed properties cost and more.

## Regression models in Python
Following our exploration of the dataset, we began cleaning it in Python and preparing it for model creation.
### 1st Round:
Steps for cleaning and preparation:
Make sure there are no NaN values or duplicates.
Lat and long drop columns
Plots using matplot and seaborn
Create a new date column for only month and year
Create a new colum with age of the property
Categorizing Zipcodes

Models i will use:
          
          - LinearRegression
          
          - MLP 
          
          - KNN
### 2nd Round:
Dropping columns with low correlation to target
Dealing with outliers
Normalizing 

Models i will use:
         
          - LinearRegression
          
          - MLP 
          
          - KNN
